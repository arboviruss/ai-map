# üåä sarEye SAR Powered Flood Mapping and Disaster Response Platform

**sarEye** is a real-time disaster-response platform built for communities affected by devastating floods. Designed during the **NASA Space Apps Hackathon**, sarEye leverages **Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)**, **Google Earth Engine**, **Next.js**, **Google Maps**, and **OpenStreetMap** to make flood data accessible, actionable, and life-saving.

When floods strike and optical satellites fail, due to cloud cover, rain, or nightfall **sarEye steps in**. By combining radar imagery with AI and intuitive maps, sarEye ensures no community disappears from the map when they need help the most.

## üöÄ Why sarEye?

Floods are among the most destructive natural disasters in **Bangladesh** and many other regions, cutting off villages, blocking roads, and endangering lives. Traditional satellite-based monitoring often fails during extreme events due to:
- Heavy cloud cover
- Persistent rainfall
- Nighttime darkness

**Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** sees through all of this. sarEye turns raw SAR data into human-friendly insights, guiding rescue efforts, aid delivery, and community resilience.

## üåê Deployment

## üåç Impact & Vision

- **Rescue teams** reach stranded families faster
- **Aid organizations** deliver resources more efficiently
- **Governments** plan evacuations with clarity
- **Communities** gain visibility and voice during disasters

> sarEye doesn‚Äôt stop at floods. It‚Äôs a **scalable disaster-response platform** adaptable to:
> - Wildfires
> - Landslides
> - Deforestation
> - Urban expansion
